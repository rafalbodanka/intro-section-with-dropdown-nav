## My process

### What I learned

During the challenge, I exercised responsiveness, css flex and grid display. I learned how to make simple dropdown lists.
Additionally, I have preloaded images from dropdown list to avoid laggy image render.

### Possible upgrades

 - Features and company views.
 - Learn more content onclick dropdown.
